Neo_twitter
===========

Neo_twitter should be based on the Tweetian backend. (This step may change depending on contribution).
It's a new Twitter client for N9, with a rebuilt UI and graphic design. The interface will be completely redesigned in order to match the nokia UX Guidelines, and update to the actual Twitter features.

The app is upcoming in 2019, and it's now (slowly) written in QT4 / QT quick as possible. 
If you're hurry to see how will be the finish app, see the navigable Adobe XD mockup:

Stay tuned N9 owner.




Here follow the original Twieetian infos
----------------------------------------

Tweetian is a feature-rich Twitter app for smartphones, developed using Qt/QML.
The backend of Tweetian is mostly written in JavaScript (database handling, API calls, parsing JSON)
but I hope to move the backend to C++ for better performance & less buggy. The UI is written purely in QML
and use a lot of components from Qt Quick Component for Symbian/MeeGo to provide native UI for each platform.

Tweetian support Symbian^3 and MeeGo Harmattan (Qt 4.7.4 and Qt 4.8.0).

Build for testing
-----------------

If you wanna build Tweetian from source, please make sure you filled in the API key/secret
for respective service in __qml/tweetian-{platform}/Constant.qml__. A default Twitter
OAuth comsumer key/secret is provided for testing.
